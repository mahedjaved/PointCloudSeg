N.B
“The pip show command does not display license metadata for setuptools. The package is maintained by the Python Packaging Authority and licensed under MIT, as documented in its official repository and PyPI listing. All Python dependencies were audited for licensing. All required libraries use permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache, PSF). Where license metadata was missing (e.g., setuptools), the license was manually verified from the official project repository.”
